Gramps ProfileView Plugin
===================
This plugin is an experimental effort to provide an alternate person view, a "Person Profile" view so to speak, that has much in common with a number of the online genealogy sites. It is hoped that it may provide an easier to navigate view for Gramps newcomers.

It can be installed by creating a plugin subdirectory ~/.gramps/gramps51/plugins/ProfileView and copying the files into place.

There are a few additional views that put a slightly different spin on the data that may be developed based on the same groundwork if time permits.
